# dispel4py_training_material
This repository is dedicated to store different training material that we have presented at different events. It contains presentations, as well several dispel4py workflows

# dispel4py
dispel4py is a free and open-source Python library for describing abstract stream-based workflows for distributed data-intensive applications. It enables users to focus on their scientific methods, avoiding distracting details and retaining flexibility over the computing infrastructure they use. It delivers mappings to diverse computing infrastructures, including cloud technologies, HPC architectures and specialised data-intensive machines, to move seamlessly into production with large-scale data loads. The dispel4py system maps workflows dynamically onto multiple enactment systems, such as MPI, STORM and Multiprocessing, without users having to modify their workflows.

# Installation

Visit the dispel4py [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dispel4py/dispel4py), which contains the instructions for installing it. 

# Material

This reporitory contains:

- dispel4py-tutorial: Two presentations [Basic](https://github.com/rosafilgueira/dispel4py_training_material/blob/master/dispel4py-tutorial/dispel4py_Basic.pdf) and [Advanced](https://github.com/rosafilgueira/dispel4py_training_material/blob/master/dispel4py-tutorial/dispel4py_Advanced.pdf) for understanding how to work with dispel4py. And a very simple dispel4py workflow (EvenOddworklow) presented as a [python script](https://github.com/rosafilgueira/dispel4py_training_material/blob/master/dispel4py-tutorial/dispel4py_example_EvenOdd/EvenOddworkflow.py) or [Ipython Notebook](https://github.com/rosafilgueira/dispel4py_training_material/blob/master/dispel4py-tutorial/dispel4py_example_EvenOdd/EvenOddworkflow.ipynb). Furthermore, it contains a very simple workflow [python](https://github.com/rosafilgueira/dispel4py_training_material/blob/master/dispel4py-tutorial/dispel4py_example_EvenOdd/My_First_dispel4py_Workflow.py) / [notebook](https://github.com/rosafilgueira/dispel4py_training_material/blob/master/dispel4py-tutorial/dispel4py_example_EvenOdd/My%20First%20dispel4py%20Workflow.ipynb)  for tesing that dispel4py installation works correctly.

- dispel4py_workflow_collection: This directory contain a set of dispel4py 'benchmark' workflows (Mycompression_exercise, My_First_dispel4py_Workflow, Testing_dispel4py, WordCount). And two simplified
real applications: Sentiment Twitter Analysis (analysis_sentiment) and Internal Galaxies Extintion (int_ext_graph). Instructions for executing the real workflows are also included (ReadmeTwitter.txt and ReadmeAstroWF.txt). The real applications are also explained at the [eScience2015 Slides](https://github.com/rosafilgueira/dispel4py_training_material/blob/master/eScience2015_dispel4py.pdf).

- Conferences presentations: [EGU-2015 Slides](https://github.com/rosafilgueira/dispel4py_training_material/blob/master/EGU2015_OpenSource_dispel4py.pdf), [eScience2015 Slides](https://github.com/rosafilgueira/dispel4py_training_material/blob/master/eScience2015_dispel4py.pdf) and [AGU2015 Slides] (Slides: https://github.com/rosafilgueira/dispel4py_training_material/blob/master/AGU2015_IN34A_dispel4py.pdf).
